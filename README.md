simple_SIR plots a simple SIR ode model with no births or deaths. The plot is made using d3.

change_parameters extends simple_SIR by allowing a user to change the parameters of the model and see the plot update in real time.

markov is similar to change_parameters but implements a simple markov SIR model and plots the average of 30 runs of the Gillespie algorithm.
